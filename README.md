# Parks Seeker Test App
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### Planning for the solution
1. Understand the requirements.
2. Choose right tools to start such as Material UI as UI library
3. React-Router-Dom for redirection.
4. TypeScript for easy of development.
5. Define workflow and create structer.
6. Implement Redux for the state management, as it is not necessary to use redux but I thought it's greate idea to use so.
7. Make Code as simple and standard as possible.
8. Create custom component where it's needed.

### Answers: -
1. How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?<br>
=> I have experiance in React, TypeScript, Material UI, Redux and these are very usefull and fast so decide to choose these.

2. Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?<br>
=> Yes, I would to add SCSS, some kind of UI workflow and imporve certain code because the deadline is about 24 hours so I gave my best to make it successful.

3. What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?<br>
=> I'll definitely change the UI first, Add some links for navigation, Add authentication to fetch API Key, write some test cases and other stuff.


Thank you for this opportunity.
